The `typedef` specifier provides a way for declaring a type alias. However, it does not introduce a new type-id. §[dcl.typedef]¶1 in the standard:

> A name declared with the `typedef` specifier becomes a *typedef-name*. A *typedef-name* names the type associated with the *identifier* (§[dcl.decl]) or *simple-template-id* (§[temp.pre]); a *typedef-name* is thus a synonym for another type. A *typedef-name* does not introduce a new type the way a class declaration (§[class.name]) or enum declaration (§[dcl.enum]) does.
