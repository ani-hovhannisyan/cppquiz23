The core of the question is "in what order are the objects destroyed?". In C++, objects are generally destroyed in the reverse order that they were constructed. `delete[]` is no exception.

§[expr.delete]¶6:

> In the case of an array, the elements will be destroyed in order of decreasing address (that is, in reverse order of the completion of their constructor; see §[class.base.init]).

So the objects are destroyed in the order `2`, `1`, `0`, and `210` is printed.
