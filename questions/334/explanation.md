This is not a compilation error, but undefined behaviour. According to §[stmt.return]¶4 in the standard:

> Flowing off the end of a constructor, a destructor, or a non-coroutine function with a *cv* `void` return type is equivalent to a `return` with no operand. Otherwise, flowing off the end of a function that is neither `main` (§[basic.start.main]) nor a coroutine (§[dcl.fct.def.coroutine]) results in undefined behavior.
